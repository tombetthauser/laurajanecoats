				The goal of Studio Art Pages is to create a fully functional donation-based alternative to profit-driven website building services like Squarespace, Other People's Pixels and Cargo Collective. The Art Pages platform will be a space where students and practicing studio artists will be able to easily build, update and host professional mobile-friendly websites for their work indefinitely with no mandatory fees. The platform is being built for artists by artists to ensure a space where we are treated as peers and not as customers.
