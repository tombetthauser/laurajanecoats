				Laura Jane's son Thomas and his wife Erin are in the process of determining an appropriate way to honor Laura Jane's artistic legacy and memory. This may take the form of a modest materials scholarship or outreach program to help encourage UC Davis undergraduates who share Laura Jane's passions and talents, reprinted editions of her books whose proceeds might go towards an appropriate cause or simply a cumulative charitable donation to an institution that supports her creative values and love for Nature.

				If you think you might have any future interest in helping us in this effort please consider signing up for the email list below. We will be in contact as soon as we have determined an appropriate and realistically achievable form of memorial.

				One of Laura Jane's greatest gifts to the world was the encouragement she gave others in their creative pursuits. For some of us, her love, support and inspirational artistic spirit have repeatedly been the defining factor in the decision to continue to commit our lives to the arts as she did. It is this love and encouragement that we hope to pass along in some small way to future young artists.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In the coming weeks this site will gradually be converted into a permanent archive for Laura Jane's life and work. We will be posting photos of her with family and friends as well as collecting documentation of the countless paintings, sculptures, books and marionettes that she created in her lifetime. If you would like to be updated when new content is added to this site please sign up for the email list below. We will be in touch soon.

				The goal of Studio Art Pages is to create a fully functional donation-based alternative to profit-driven website building services like Squarespace, Other People's Pixels and Cargo Collective. The Art Pages platform will be a space where students and practicing studio artists will be able to easily build, update and host professional mobile-friendly websites for their work indefinitely with no mandatory fees. The platform is being built for artists by artists to ensure a space where we are treated as peers and not as customers.
