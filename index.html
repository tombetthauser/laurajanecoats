				Dear friends and family,
			</p>
			<p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Just after Thanksgiving of 2018 Laura Jane abruptly fell ill. She had privately been receiving testing for an illness that had shown almost no symptoms until October and did not become serious until just before the holidays began. On the 25th of November she was admitted to Rideout Memorial Hospital in Marysville with her son, daughter-in-law, sisters and mother by her side. She remained cheerful and cognizant throughout the week – smiling, cracking jokes, telling stories, charming all the hospital staff and remaining utterly at peace. 
			</p><p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The following Friday afternoon, in spite of her unbelievable strength and positivity, she passed away peacefully hand-in-hand with her son and her eldest sister.
			</p><p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				This has been an extreme shock to all of us, and we are still processing how abruptly it occurred. We have tried earnestly to contact all of her friends and former colleagues in San Francisco, Marin, Sacramento and Nevada City, but we regret that we were not able to find contact information for all of you so we encourage you to please forward this message to anyone outside the family who's life she graced that we may not have yet reached.
			</p><p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				As per her wishes a service was held for her two weeks after her passing at Sutter Cemetery where she was laid to rest in a casket built by her family and friends along side her father and the Sutter Butte mountains that so often appeared in her work and gave her inspiration.
			</p><p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In the coming weeks this site will gradually be converted into a permanent archive for Laura Jane's life and work. We will be posting photos of her with family and friends as well as collecting documentation of the countless paintings, sculptures, books and marionettes that she created in her lifetime. If you would like to be updated when new content is added to this site please sign up for the email list below. We will be in touch soon.
			</p><p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Additionally a sale including many of her sculptures, furniture and objects of inspiration will be organized in the coming weeks for friends and extended family members. And finally the family is planning to establish a modest memorial fund whose form will be determined after we have appropriately addressed her home, legal and financial matters. You can find more information regarding this at the bottom of this page. If you would like to be updated regarding any of this please sign up for the email list linked below. 
			</p><p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Thank you all so much for your love and support,
			</p><p class="p-normal">

			<h3>Memorial Fund</h3>
			<p class="p-normal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Laura Jane's son Thomas and his wife Erin are in the process of determining an appropriate way to honor Laura Jane's artistic legacy and memory. This may take the form of a modest materials scholarship or outreach program to help encourage UC Davis undergraduates who share Laura Jane's passions and talents, reprinted editions of her books whose proceeds might go towards an appropriate cause or simply a cumulative charitable donation to an institution that supports her creative values and love for Nature.
			</p>
			<p class="p-normal">
				<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -->
				If you think you might have any future interest in helping us in this effort please consider signing up for the email list below. We will be in contact as soon as we have determined an appropriate and realistic form of memorial.

			<p class="p-normal">
				<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -->
				If you happen to feel comfortable contributing any small or large amount before knowing the exact form the memorial fund will take we have also set up a contribution site through PayPal for the time being. Please be assured that we will regard any contributions with the utmost seriousness and will keep all contributors fully updated with the memorial plans as they take shape.

				One of Laura Jane's greatest gifts to the world was the encouragement she gave others in their creative pursuits. For some of us her love, support and inspirational artistic spirit have repeatedly been the defining factor in the decision to continue to commit our lives to the arts as she did. It is this love and encouragement that we hope to pass on in some small way to others that share her spirit and passions.

				The goal of Studio Art Pages is to create a fully functional donation-based alternative to profit-driven website building services like Squarespace, Other People's Pixels and Cargo Collective. The Art Pages platform will be a space where students and practicing studio artists will be able to easily build, update and host professional mobile-friendly websites for their work indefinitely with no mandatory fees. The platform is being built for artists by artists to ensure a space where we are treated as peers and not as customers.
